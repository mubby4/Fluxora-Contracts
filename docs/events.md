# Contract event schema

This document lists all events emitted by the `FluxoraStream` contract, the exact
topics used, and the data schema (field names and Rust/Soroban types). Use this
as the canonical source of truth for indexers and backend parsers. The schemas
below are derived directly from the contract source `contracts/stream/src/lib.rs`.

Notes:

- Soroban events contain an ordered list of topics and a single `data` payload.
- Topics shown below are the literal values used in `env.events().publish(...)`.
- Types use the contract's Rust types (e.g. `u64`, `i128`, `Address`).
- Keep this file in sync with the contract when event shapes change.

## Event list

| Event name       | Topic(s)                        | Data (shape & types)                                                                                                                                      | When emitted                                                                                                            |

## Exact Soroban event structure

Soroban events are represented as JSON in test snapshots; the general shape is:

- **topics**: array of topic items (symbols or values)
- **data**: a value (single item) which can be a primitive, a struct, or a tuple

### 1) StreamCreated

Emitted by `persist_new_stream` after a successful `create_stream`, `create_streams`, or `create_streams_partial` call.

```
topics: ["created", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   StreamCreated {
          stream_id:              u64,
          sender:                 Address,
          recipient:              Address,
          deposit_amount:         i128,
          rate_per_second:        i128,
          start_time:             u64,
          cliff_time:             u64,
          end_time:               u64,
          withdraw_dust_threshold: i128,
          memo:                   Option<Bytes>,   // None when not supplied; max 64 bytes
          metadata:               Option<Map<Bytes,Bytes>>,  // None when not supplied
        }
```

Example JSON (illustrative):

```json
{
  "topics": ["created", 0],
  "data": {
    "stream_id": 0,
    "sender": "G...SENDER...",
    "recipient": "G...RECIPIENT...",
    "deposit_amount": 1000,
    "rate_per_second": 1,
    "start_time": 0,
    "cliff_time": 0,
    "end_time": 1000
  }
}
```

### 2) Withdrawal

Emitted by `withdraw` and each stream in `batch_withdraw` when `withdrawable > 0`.

```
topics: ["withdrew", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   Withdrawal {
          stream_id: u64,
          recipient: Address,
          amount:    i128,
        }
```

Example:

```json
{
  "topics": ["withdrew", 0],
  "data": { "stream_id": 0, "recipient": "G...RECIPIENT...", "amount": 300 }
}
```

### 3) WithdrawalTo

Emitted by `withdraw_to` when `withdrawable > 0`. The `destination` field holds the
address that actually receives the tokens; `recipient` is the stream's registered
recipient (the authorised caller).

```
topics: ["wdraw_to", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   WithdrawalTo {
          stream_id:   u64,
          recipient:   Address,
          destination: Address,
          amount:      i128,
        }
```

### 4) StreamPaused / StreamResumed / StreamCancelled / StreamCompleted / StreamClosed

**StreamPaused** uses the new `StreamPaused` struct (introduced in `CONTRACT_VERSION = 3`):

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub struct StreamPaused {
    pub stream_id: u64,
    pub reason: soroban_sdk::String,
}

#[contracttype]
pub enum PauseReason {
    Operational   = 0,  // Routine sender-initiated pause
    Administrative = 1, // Admin-initiated pause
    Emergency     = 2,  // Security-related pause
    Compliance    = 3,  // Regulatory/compliance hold
}
```

| Function(s)                                                  | Topic         | Data                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `pause_stream`, `pause_stream_as_admin`                      | `"paused"`    | `StreamPaused { stream_id, reason }` |
| `resume_stream`, `resume_stream_as_admin`                    | `"resumed"`   | `StreamEvent::Resumed(id)`         |
| `cancel_stream`, `cancel_stream_as_admin`                    | `"cancelled"` | `StreamEvent::StreamCancelled(id)` |
| `withdraw`, `batch_withdraw` (final drain on Active streams) | `"completed"` | `StreamEvent::StreamCompleted(id)` |
| `close_completed_stream`                                     | `"closed"`    | `StreamEvent::StreamClosed(id)`    |

> **Breaking change (v3):** The `"paused"` event data changed from `StreamEvent::Paused(stream_id)`
> to `StreamPaused { stream_id, reason }`. The `reason` field is a `String` (serialised reason code).
> Indexers must update their pause event parsers.
> `CONTRACT_VERSION` was bumped to `3` to signal this incompatibility.

Example (paused with reason):

```json
{
  "topics": ["paused", 0],
  "data": { "stream_id": 0, "reason": "Operational" }
}
```

`StreamCancelled` does not embed refund or timestamp fields in the payload.
Indexers should read `get_stream_state(stream_id)` to obtain `cancelled_at` and derive refund
from state plus accrual (`refund = deposit_amount - accrued_at_cancelled_at`).

Example (completed — emitted after the Withdrawal event on the same call):

```json
{
  "topics": ["completed", 0],
  "data": { "StreamCompleted": 0 }
}
```

> **Indexers:** the `stream_id` appears both as the second topic and inside the
> enum payload. Read it from the topic for efficiency; use the payload only for
> cross-checking.

### 5) RateUpdated

```
topics: ["rate_upd", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   RateUpdated {
          stream_id:           u64,
          old_rate_per_second: i128,
          new_rate_per_second: i128,
          effective_time:      u64,
        }
```

### 6) StreamEndShortened

```
topics: ["end_shrt", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   StreamEndShortened {
          stream_id:     u64,
          old_end_time:  u64,
          new_end_time:  u64,
          refund_amount: i128,
        }
```

Emission guarantees:
- Emitted exactly once on successful `shorten_stream_end_time`.
- Not emitted on failed shorten calls (`InvalidParams`, `InvalidState`, auth failure).

### 7) StreamEndExtended

```
topics: ["end_ext", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   StreamEndExtended {
          stream_id:    u64,
          old_end_time: u64,
          new_end_time: u64,
        }
```

### 8) StreamToppedUp

This event is emitted only after the top-up has succeeded. Validation failures,
authorization failures, arithmetic overflow, or failed token pulls emit no
`top_up` contract event.

```
topics: ["top_up", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   StreamToppedUp {
          stream_id:          u64,
          top_up_amount:      i128,
          new_deposit_amount: i128,
          new_end_time:       u64,  // end_time after the top-up (unchanged by top-up itself)
        }
```

### 9) AdminUpdated

Emitted by `set_admin`.

```
topics: ["AdminUpdated"]
data:   (old_admin: Address, new_admin: Address)
```

Example:

```json
{
  "topics": ["AdminUpdated"],
  "data": ["G...OLD_ADDRESS...", "G...NEW_ADDRESS..."]
}
```

### 10) ProtocolPaused

Emitted by `pause_protocol` when the protocol is successfully paused.
**Not emitted** on idempotent calls (when already paused).

```
topics: ["pr_pause", admin: Address]
data:   ProtocolPaused {
          reason: String,
          paused_at: u64,
        }
```

Example:

```json
{
  "topics": ["pr_pause", "G...ADMIN_ADDRESS..."],
  "data": {
    "reason": "security incident",
    "paused_at": 1234567
  }
}
```

### 11) ProtocolResumed

Emitted by `resume_protocol` when the protocol is successfully resumed.
**Not emitted** on idempotent calls (when not paused).

```
topics: ["pr_resume", admin: Address]
data:   ProtocolResumed {
          resumed_at: u64,
        }
```

Example:

```json
{
  "topics": ["pr_resume", "G...ADMIN_ADDRESS..."],
  "data": {
    "resumed_at": 2345678
  }
}
```

### 12) SenderTransferred

Emitted by `transfer_sender` when the stream sender is successfully rotated.

```
topics: ["sndr_xfr", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   SenderTransferred {
          stream_id:  u64,
          old_sender: Address,
          new_sender: Address,
        }
```

Example JSON:

```json
{
  "topics": ["sndr_xfr", 0],
  "data": {
    "stream_id": 0,
    "old_sender": "G...OLD_SENDER...",
    "new_sender": "G...NEW_SENDER..."
  }
}
```

## On-chain Pause Audit Trail

In addition to events, the contract maintains an on-chain audit trail of the last pause action for each pause kind. This is queryable via `get_last_pause_record(kind: PauseKind)`.

### PauseKind

- `GlobalEmergency`: Toggled via `set_global_emergency_paused`.
- `Protocol`: Toggled via `pause_protocol`.
- `Stream`: Toggled via `pause_stream_as_admin`.

### PauseRecord

```rust
pub struct PauseRecord {
    pub actor: Address,
    pub timestamp: u64,
    pub reason: String,
}
```

### 13) KeeperCancelled

Emitted by `keeper_cancel` after all token transfers succeed (CEI-compliant). The
event carries the full fee breakdown so off-chain indexers can reconstruct keeper
economics without inspecting individual token transfers.

**Fee accounting identity (always holds):**
```
keeper_fee + recipient_amount + sender_refund == deposit_amount - prior_withdrawn_amount
```

```
topics: ["kp_cncl", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   KeeperCancelled {
          stream_id:        u64,    // stream that was cancelled
          keeper:           Address, // keeper who triggered cancellation
          keeper_fee:       i128,   // KEEPER_FEE_BPS (50 bps) of gross sender refund
          recipient_amount: i128,   // accrued - prior withdrawals (may be 0)
          sender_refund:    i128,   // unstreamed deposit minus keeper fee
        }
```

Example (partial accrual, deposit=10000, accrued=5000):

```json
{
  "topics": ["kp_cncl", 7],
  "data": {
    "stream_id": 7,
    "keeper": "G...KEEPER...",
    "keeper_fee": 25,
    "recipient_amount": 5000,
    "sender_refund": 4975
  }
}
```

Example (fully accrued, zero keeper fee):

```json
{
  "topics": ["kp_cncl", 12],
  "data": {
    "stream_id": 12,
    "keeper": "G...KEEPER...",
    "keeper_fee": 0,
    "recipient_amount": 1000,
    "sender_refund": 0
  }
}
```

**Indexer notes:**
- `keeper_fee` is always `floor(unstreamed * 50 / 10000)`.
- A fully-accrued stream has `sender_refund = 0` and `keeper_fee = 0`.
- The event is emitted in the same transaction as the state write to `Cancelled`;
  no `StreamCancelled` event is emitted for keeper-initiated cancellations.

### 14) StreamHealthChanged

Emitted by `decrease_rate_per_second`, `shorten_stream_end_time`, `top_up_stream`,
and `cancel_stream` when the stream's funding health status transitions between
adequately funded and underfunded.

A stream is **underfunded** when `remaining_balance < rate_per_second × seconds_remaining`.
Terminal streams (`Completed`, `Cancelled`) have `seconds_remaining = 0` and are never underfunded.

This event is only emitted when the `is_underfunded` flag actually changes, not on every mutation.

```
topics: ["health", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   StreamHealthChanged {
          stream_id:         u64,
          is_underfunded:    bool,
          remaining_balance: i128,
          seconds_remaining: u64,
        }
```

Example (stream became underfunded after rate decrease):

```json
{
  "topics": ["health", 0],
  "data": {
    "stream_id": 0,
    "is_underfunded": true,
    "remaining_balance": 500,
    "seconds_remaining": 800
  }
}
```

Example (stream became adequately funded after top-up):

```json
{
  "topics": ["health", 0],
  "data": {
    "stream_id": 0,
    "is_underfunded": false,
    "remaining_balance": 1200,
    "seconds_remaining": 800
  }
}
```

Indexers should use this event to surface underfunded streams proactively.
The `remaining_balance` and `seconds_remaining` fields allow precise monitoring dashboards.

## Parsing recommendations for indexers


- Use `topics[0]` to filter by event type; use `topics[1]` to get the `stream_id`
  for all stream-level events.
- **v9 breaking event-payload change**: Starting from `CONTRACT_VERSION = 9`, the `amount` field on a `Withdrawal` event emitted by `delegated_withdraw` reports the **recipient's net amount** (`gross_withdrawable − relayer_fee`), **not** the gross withdrawable total. Indexers, dashboards, and accounting pipelines built against pre-v9 fixtures need to recompute against this new semantics, otherwise they will under-report by `relayer_fee`. The `Withdrawal.amount` from
  plain `withdraw` / `withdraw_to` / `batch_withdraw` paths is **unchanged** (still equals the amount transferred). Only the `delegated_withdraw` path now reports the net.
- For `Withdrawal` and `WithdrawalTo`, the `amount` field is `i128` — use a
  big-int library that supports 128-bit signed integers.
- `StreamCompleted` is emitted on the **same call** as the final `Withdrawal` that drains
  an `Active` stream. Cancelled streams do not transition to `Completed`.
- `StreamClosed` signals that the stream's on-chain storage has been removed.
  After this event, `get_stream_state` returns `StreamNotFound` for that ID.
- `AdminUpdated` has a single-element topic list (no stream_id).

> **See [docs/indexer-derivation.md](./indexer-derivation.md)** for the complete
> specification of how to derive stream state from events, when to call
> `get_stream_state`, and worked examples for each lifecycle path (including
> cancellation, rate changes, and completion).

## Factory contract events (`fluxora_factory`)

All state-changing factory entrypoints emit structured events. Topics are ≤ 9
characters (`symbol_short!` constraint). Naming mirrors `FluxoraStream` where
applicable (e.g. `AdminUpd`).

| Event name | Topic(s) | Data (shape & types) | When emitted |
|---|---|---|---|
| FactoryInited | `["fct_init"]` | `FactoryInited { admin: Address, stream_contract: Address, max_deposit: i128, min_duration: u64 }` | Once, when `init` completes successfully. |
| FactoryAdminUpdated | `["AdminUpd"]` | `FactoryAdminUpdated { old_admin: Address, new_admin: Address }` | When `set_admin` rotates the factory admin. |
| StreamContractUpdated | `["stm_upd"]` | `StreamContractUpdated { old_contract: Address, new_contract: Address }` | When `set_stream_contract` changes the stream-contract pointer. |
| AllowlistUpdated | `["allow_upd"]` | `AllowlistUpdated { recipient: Address, allowed: bool }` | When `set_allowlist` adds (`allowed: true`) or removes (`allowed: false`) a recipient. |
| CapUpdated | `["cap_upd"]` | `CapUpdated { old_cap: i128, new_cap: i128 }` | When `set_cap` updates the factory deposit cap. |
| MinDurationUpdated | `["dur_upd"]` | `MinDurationUpdated { old_min_duration: u64, new_min_duration: u64 }` | When `set_min_duration` updates the minimum stream duration policy. |
| RateBoundsUpdated | `["rate_bnd"]` | `RateBoundsUpdated { min_rate: Option<i128>, max_rate: Option<i128> }` | When `set_rate_bounds` updates rate-per-second bounds. `None` = argument not supplied by caller. |
| FactoryPaused/Resumed | `["factory", "paused"]` / `["factory", "resumed"]` | `bool` | When `set_factory_paused` toggles the pause flag (pre-existing). |
| FactoryStreamCreated | `["fct_strm"]` | `FactoryStreamCreated { stream_id: u64, sender: Address, recipient: Address, deposit_amount: i128, rate_per_second: i128 }` | After a policy-gated `create_stream` or batch `create_streams` succeeds (emits one event per created stream). Not emitted on any validation or downstream failure. |

### Example JSON (FactoryStreamCreated)

## Governance contract events (`fluxora_governance`)

All state-changing governance entrypoints emit structured events. Topics are ≤ 9
characters (`symbol_short!` constraint). 

| Event name | Topic(s) | Data (shape & types) | When emitted |
|---|---|---|---|
| ProposalCreated | `["proposed", proposal_id: u32]` | `ProposalCreated { proposal_id: u32, proposer: Address, target: Address }` | When `propose` is called successfully. |
| ProposalApproved | `["approved", proposal_id: u32]` | `ProposalApproved { proposal_id: u32, approver: Address, approval_count: u32 }` | When a co-signer successfully approves a proposal. |
| QuorumReached | `["quorum", proposal_id: u32]` | `QuorumReached { proposal_id: u32, quorum_reached_at: u64, executable_after: u64 }` | When a proposal reaches the approval threshold. |
| ProposalCancelled | `["cancelled", proposal_id: u32]` | `ProposalCancelled { proposal_id: u32, canceller: Address }` | When a proposal is cancelled. |
| ProposalExecuted | `["executed", proposal_id: u32]` | `ProposalExecuted { proposal_id: u32, executor: Address, target: Address, calldata: Bytes }` | When a proposal is executed successfully. |
| SignerAdded | `["sgnr_add"]` | `SignerAdded { signer: Address }` | When `add_signer` adds a new co-signer. |
| SignerRemoved | `["sgnr_rm"]` | `SignerRemoved { signer: Address }` | When `remove_signer` successfully removes a co-signer. |
| AdminChanged | `["adm_chg"]` | `AdminChanged { old: Address, new: Address }` | When the contract admin is rotated. |
| QuorumConfig | `["quor_cfg"]` | `QuorumConfig { threshold: u32, signer_count: u32 }` | Emitted after `SignerAdded` and `SignerRemoved` to allow indexers to track quorum health and threshold satisfiability. |

## Keeping this doc in sync

This file is derived from `contracts/stream/src/lib.rs`, `contracts/stream/src/events.rs`, and `contracts/stream/src/types.rs`. Each event is emitted by its corresponding helper in `events.rs` or directly from `lib.rs`. The canonical source of truth for event payload structs is `lib.rs` and `types.rs`.

Event emit helpers are in `contracts/stream/src/events.rs`. The test in `tests/event_schema_consistency.rs` cross-checks every event struct against the documented shapes below. Both the test and this document must be updated when event payloads change.

If you change event topics or payloads in the contract, please update this
document to match and include example snapshots.
